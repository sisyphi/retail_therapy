## Development
As my first venture into SvelteKit, this project was used to learn the basics of the framework and explore what it can do. This project is still in progress as I am continuously learning the framework. As I progress with others projects, I will continue to improve this one as a proof of concept of the lessons learned.

## Technologies
- SvelteKit for Frontend & Backend
- Netlify for Hosting
